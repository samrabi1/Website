      <description>Income and Poverty Rates and Teen Pregnancy in Texas Counties Introduction The following report demonstrates data wrangling and exploration for two datasets that describe rates of teenage pregnancy and income demographics and poverty rates across the 200+ counties in the state of Texas. Given the wide range of types of communities in Texas, it can be interesting to explore the differences in statistics such as these across the state. One dataset, obtained from https://www.</description>

      <description>Introduction The following report demonstrates the use of a variety of techniques to perform tests and make predictions about as well as model the relationships between variables included in the WalkTheDogs dataset included in the Stat2Data package. The package includes a variety of datasets featured in the textbook STAT2: Modeling with Regression and ANOVA: Modelling with Regression and ANOVA (package written by Robin Lock). The dataset contains daily information collected by one of the authors of the textbook from a pedometer, as well as description of the weather conditions, and whether or not he walked his dogs.</description>

      <description>One of the most essential and useful skills that we learned this semester was the use of packages and functions that allow for easy and efficient data wrangling. In R, this was achieved through use of dplyr functions and more recently we explored the use of pandas functions that accomplish the same tasks in Python. The following blog post demonstrates the functionality of both sets of functions in their respective languages using the iris dataset.</description>
